Spotify Clone <br>
Crafted with passion for music and code, this Spotify Clone is a melodic symphony brought to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>

Designed to mirror the essence of Spotify, this responsive website elegantly mimics core music player functionalities, allowing users to immerse themselves in the rhythm of their favourite tracks. <br><br>

From curated playlists to intuitive play and pause controls, every interactive UI component is built to offer a seamless and harmonious user experience. <br><br>

Developing this project not only strengthened my frontend development skills but also deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design – the very elements that compose the music of the web. <br><br>

✨ Future Prospects <br>
Looking forward, this project aspires to integrate dynamic backend support and real-time streaming APIs, enabling users to build personalized playlists, discover trending music, and experience a fully functional digital concert hall right at their fingertips. <br><br>
